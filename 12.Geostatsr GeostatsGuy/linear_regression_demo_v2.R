# Linear Regression in R for Engineers and Geoscientists New to R

# This will be used in my Introduction to Geostatistics Undergraduate Class 
# It is assumed that students have no previous R experience.  

# Version 2: Porosity Predicted from Density

# Load the required libraries, you may have to first go to "Tools/Install Packages..." to install these first
library(plyr)                                  # splitting, applying and combining data by Hadley Wickham 

# Set the working directory, I always like to do this so I don't lose files and to simplify subsequent read and writes
setwd("C:/PGE337")

# Read the data table from a comma delimited file
mydata = read.csv("Density_Por_data.csv")      # read csv file

# Let's visualize the first several rows of our data so we can make sure we successfully loaded it
head(mydata)                                   # show the first several rows of a data table in the console
# The columns are variables with variable names at the top and the rows are samples

# Extract the variables of interest from the table into vectors.Well B porosity and permeability. 
# You are welcome to try linear regression with Well A also.
den <- mydata$Density                          # make a new vector from the PorosityB variable in our data table 
por <- mydata$Porosity                         # make a new vector from the PemreabilityB variable in our data table 

# It is a good idea to first explore our variables.
par(mfrow=c(3,2))                              # set up a 2x2 matrix of plots 

# We start with the scatter plot of Perm and Ln(perm) vs. Porosity for Well B. 
plot(den,por,main="Well Porosity (%) vs. Density (g/cm3)",xlab=" Density (g/cm3) ",ylab=" Porosity (%) ")
# From this scatter plots it is clear that we should build a linear model of Porosity vs. Density.

# Let's check the variable distributions density first and then porosity
hist(den,main="Well Density",xlab="Density (g/cm3)",nclass = 15) # Hist builds a regular frequency histogram
# ecdf makes a cdf object and plot command plots it
plot(ecdf(den),main="Well Density (%)",xlab="Density (g/cm3)",ylab="Cumulative Probability")
# Now summary statistics, check the console
summary(den)

# Now let's check the natural log of permeability distribution
hist(por,main="Well Porosity ",xlab="Porosity (%)",nclass = 15) # hist builds a regular frequency histogram
# ecdf makes a cdf object and plot command plots it
plot(ecdf(por),main="Well Porosity (%)",xlab="Porosity (%)",ylab="Cumulative Probability")
# Now summary statistics, check the console
summary(por)

# The data looks good. Distributions do mot have gaps, spikes nor outliers.
# and check the summary statistics. 
summary(mydata)

# Now we are ready to calculate a linear regression model to predict ln(permeability) from porosity
por.lm = lm(por ~ den,data=mydata)     # our linear model predicts lmpermB from porB  

# To just see the resulting model use this command
print(por.lm)

# The linear model object ("lnpermB.lm") is very convenient. It includes all the information we need for hypothesis testing, and 
# confidence and prediction intervals.  In fact the hypothesis tests are completed automatically. 
lm.summary = summary(por.lm, correlation = TRUE)

# Let's check the statistical significance of the model coefficients.  
print(lm.summary$coefficients)
# Coefficients: You can observed the estimated model parameter, standard error and resulting t-statistic and the two-tailed
# probability of >|t-statistic| or the maximum level that one would reject at.  We reject the null hypothesis that 
# the model coefficients slope (porB) and intercept (intercept) are equal to 0.0.

print(lm.summary$fstatistic)
# F-statistic: is calculate from difference in sum of square error between the model and a constant slope model.
# We clearly reject the reduced, constant slope model in favour of the full model given fcrtical from f(0.95,DF1=1,DF2=103)=3.93

# Let's check the distribution of outliers for bias and outliers
hist(lm.summary$residuals,main="LM Residuals (ln(mD)",xlab="Residuals (ln(mD))",nclass = 15) # Hist builds a regular frequency histogram
summary(lm.summary$residuals)
# The residuals look good, the mean = 0.0 and there are no outliers.

# One could visualize all this output in the console with the summary command
summary(por.lm, correlation = TRUE) 

# Let's get the confidence intervals in the fitted model parameters
confint(por.lm,level = 0.95)
# We get the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals for both intercept and slope

# Let's demonstrate prediction intervals
prediction = predict(por.lm,interval="predict")
head(prediction)
# We now have a data table with the model fit and prediction intervals for all of our porosity data

# Furthermore lm has built in diagnostic plots that are very useful for checking our model
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
plot(por.lm)
# Residual vs Fitted to check linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions.  Check for large residuals / biased expectation.
# Normal Q-Q to check the normality in the residuals assumption.  Points should be on the 45 degree line.
# Scale-Location to check assumption of homoscedasticity.  There should not be a pattern.
# Residual vs. Leverage to identify poorly fit data that have large influence on the model (leverage).
