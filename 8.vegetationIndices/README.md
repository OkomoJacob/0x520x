### Interpretation of the Indices 
#### 1. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI
<img ndvi>
NDVI is a numerical indicator that uses the Red and Near-infrared spectral bands from a sensor. NDVI is highly associated with vegetation content. High NDVI values correspond to areas that reflect more in the near-infrared spectrum, hence corresponding to denser and healthier vegetation.It was observed that Sentinel 2 MSI sensor was more sensitive to NDVI  over L8 OLI and had values ranging from -0.4 to 0.6 as opposed to L8 OLI that scored -0.1 to 0.4 for the same study area.
