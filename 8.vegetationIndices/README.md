### Interpretation of the Indices 
#### 1. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI  = 𝑵𝑰𝑹-Red/𝑵𝑰𝑹+Red

NDVI is a numerical indicator that uses the Red and Near-infrared spectral bands from a sensor. NDVI is highly associated with vegetation content. High NDVI values correspond to areas that reflect more in the near-infrared spectrum, hence corresponding to denser and healthier vegetation.It was observed that Sentinel 2 MSI sensor was more sensitive to NDVI  over L8 OLI and had values ranging from -0.4 to 0.6 as opposed to L8 OLI that scored -0.1 to 0.4 for the same study area. 


#### 2. Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index GNDVI = 𝑵𝑰𝑹−𝑮𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒏/𝑵𝑰𝑹+𝑮𝒓𝒆𝒆n

GNDVI is a vegetation index for estimating photosynthetic activity and is a commonly used vegetation index to determine water and nitrogen uptake into the plant canopy. Compared to the NDVI index, it is more sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. It is used in assessing depressed and aged vegetation.It was observed that Sentinel 2 MSI sensor was more sensitive to NDVI over L8 OLI and had values ranging from -0.4 to 0.6 as opposed to L8 OLI that scored -0.1 to 0.4 for the same study area
